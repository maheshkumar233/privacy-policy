Temporary data such as cooldowns, role IDs, and command usage is stored in memory only for the current session.

No permanent logs or history are saved unless explicitly coded (and currently, they are not).

The bot does not share any information with third parties.

Data Deletion:

Restarting the bot clears all in-memory data like cooldowns and revive setups.

No persistent database is currently used.

Only the bot owner has access to the source code and token.

Commands are permission-locked to avoid unauthorized access.

üìå Disclaimer
This bot is provided "as is" without warranty. The bot owner is not responsible for actions performed using the bot by others in your server. Use responsibly.
